# HackTM2023

This is the project named RecipeDex made by the team <echipa_nume\\> in the hackathon HackTM 2023
It was realised with a front end made in Angular, backend in nodejs and database in mongoDb.

The project aims to service as a site where the users can search for food recipes. Then
the ingredients are searched all over Timisoara city's food shops. The matching shops
are then marked on a map for the user to see. There is also a list with the cheapest places
to buy certain ingredients, but also what shop is the best to buy at overall.

In the future we aim to integrate the service with Tazz and or Glovo for those users who do
not want to get the ingredients themselves or just want to save some time.
